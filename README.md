# azure-cloud-docs
Repository containing all work focused on Azure cloud.

---

## Getting Started
First, download the attached file named **Cloud Docs.pdf**.  
This file contains links to all required documentation and serves as the entry point into the workspace.

---

## What’s in Here
The workspace is organized into rows, with each row representing a single document.  
Here’s how to interpret the columns:

- **Rows = individual docs** → Each row corresponds to one document. Open it to read the full content.  
- **Doc name** → The title of the document.  
- **Category** → Tags that describe the type of document. Categories include:  
  - **Guide** → Step‑by‑step instructions for weekly work.  
  - **Lab** → Hands‑on lab exercises.  
  - **Research** → In‑depth research work.  
  - **Dictionary** → Reference material explaining terms and details.  
- **Number** → A simple grouping by week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2) or “All” for documents not tied to a specific week.

---

## Useful Views
The workspace provides multiple views to help you navigate and organize documents:

- **All Docs** → A table focused on cloud items, sorted by Week and Category.  
- **Published Docs** → A list of documents, displayed with the newest first.  
- **Docs by Category** → A table grouped by Category, making it easy to scan related documents.  
- **Board** → A simple table view that you can sort or filter as needed.  

💡 **Tip:** Use the view tabs to switch perspectives quickly. You can also add filters, such as `Category = "Guide"` or `Week = "Week 1"`, to narrow down the list.

## How to Read a Doc
To get the most out of each document:

1. **Open a row** → Click on the row to see the full page content.  
2. **Skim the Doc name and Category** → This helps you understand the intent and type of the document.  
3. **Check the Number** → Use the week grouping to place the document in context.

## Summary
This repository is designed to keep all Azure cloud documentation organized, accessible, and easy to navigate.  
By using categories, week numbers, and multiple views, you can quickly find the right guide, lab, research, or dictionary entry for your work.
